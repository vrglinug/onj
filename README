ONJ

INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS
==================================================
1. Place these files in a directory under your web root
2. Edit setup and set the variables to appropriate values
3. Run ./setup

WARNING
==================================================
1. Do NOT run setup after the initial installation. It resets the database.

HOW TO UPDATE PROBLEMS
==================================================
1. Problems are stored under the problems/ directory
2. In this directory, you will find subfolders 1/ 2/ 3/ 4/ 5/, each holding data for the corresponding problem
3. Under each of these, you will find 3 files:
	- statement : This contains the html of the problem statement
	- in : This is the system test input file
	- out : This is the expected output that the program should produce
4. You can also edit problems from the problem page if you are logged in as admin

HOW TO CHANGE SETTINGS AFTER INITIAL SETUP
==================================================
1. Play around with settings.php

ADMIN ACCOUNT
==================================================
The admin account is 'admin' with password 'onj'. To change the password, either manually do it in the database (ugly) or edit the dbinit.sql file before running setup
==================================================

ADDING SECURITY FEATURE
While setting up onj using apache server, prevent access to files/directories by following these instructions:

Open the file /etc/apache2/apache2.conf

Insert the following lines of code:

<Directory /var/www/html/onj/problems>
  Order Deny,Allow
  Deny from all
</Directory>


<Directory /var/www/html/onj/code>
  Order Deny,Allow
  Deny from all
</Directory>
