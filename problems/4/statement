The binary weight of a positive integer is the number of 1's in its binary representation. 
For example, the decimal number 1 has a binary weight of 1, and the decimal number 7 (which is 111 in binary) has a binary weight of 3.
<br/><br/>
Given a positive integer <strong>N</strong>, find the smallest integer greater than <strong>N</strong> that has the same binary weight as <strong>N</strong>.

<br/><br/>

<strong>INPUT</strong><br/>
The first line of input contains a number <strong>T</strong> the number of test cases.
The next <strong>T</strong> lines contain a number <strong>N</strong>.

<br/><br/>

<strong>OUTPUT</strong><br/>
For each test case output a line containing the smallest number greater than <strong>N</strong> which has the same binary weight as <strong>N</strong>.

<br/><br/>

<strong>CONSTRAINTS</strong><br/>
1 &lt;= <strong>N</strong> &lt;= 10000
