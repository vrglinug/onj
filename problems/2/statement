The strength of a pair integer sequences is defined by the number of integers that they have in common. You are required to find the strength of several pairs of integer sequences.

<br/><br/>

<strong>INPUT</strong><br/>
The first line of input contains <strong>T</strong>, the number of test cases.
<strong>T</strong> test cases follow. Each test case contains <strong>3</strong> lines. The first line contains two integers <strong>N</strong> and <strong>M</strong>, which are the lengths of the two sequences. The next two lines contain the sequences.

<br/><br/>

<strong>OUTPUT</strong><br/>
This should contain <strong>T</strong> lines, each containing an integer representing the strength of the pair of sequences for the corresponding test case.

<br/><br/>

<strong>CONSTRAINTS</strong><br/>
The length of each sequence will be between <strong>1</strong> and <strong>20</strong> inclusive<br/>
A sequence can contain an integer between <strong>1</strong> and <strong>100</strong> inclusive<br/>
Sequences will not contain duplicate integers
